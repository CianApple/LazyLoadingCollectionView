LazyLoadingCollectionView
=========================

Implemented lazy loading in UICollectionView using image URL's. Tried more than 5400 images in a single collection view and it works perfectly.

 This project is used to demonstrate the lazy loading of large number of images in a collectionview. This same technique can be used to display
 images in a tableview or scrollview lazily.

 I have tried to use all the different techniques that can be utilised for lazy loading. So far I think this is the best way to lazy load
 list of images in a collectionview, tableview or scrollview.
 https://github.com/path/FastImageCache  - Refer this link. It has the best documentation for learning different logics to help improve lazy
 loading. I myself referred this project to combine all the best methods which led me to develop this project which I think is by far the best
 memory efficient, fast, without lag lazy loading example. I personally have tested this collectionview with more than 5400 images and it works
 excellently. Just copy the url multiple times in ImageList.txt file to test it yourself.

 Initially in my live projects, I noticed that such functionality is needed in every other project whether it be collectionview,
 pageviewcontroller, tableview or scrollview. But I was really frustrated for not finding out a good solution for it. This piece of project can
 be utilised in every other project of yours too.

 Lazy loading of image is inspired from apple's example and it works perfectly. Hope this will help you guys in your projects too. If anyone
 finds any bugs in this project, please do let me know about it.
